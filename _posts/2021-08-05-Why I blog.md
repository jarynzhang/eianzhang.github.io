I have registered account[[Medium](https://medium.com/@eian.zhang)] for many years and never published a story about who I was and what intention I held while making this registration, cause I can not figure it out accurately. But things went clear when I’m getting to that age where it’s easier to remember your childhood holidays than it is to recall what you did last week.

To pursue the passions behind the popularity and shininess of technology at that very time,  we are chasing awareness of ourselves. By doing this, you might think you are among the most advanced people in the world, the freshness and attractive style of the “tech-things” confused your thoughts about the world and human beings living in it.

Fortunately, we are not late, and it will never be too later.

If you ask me what I would do if given a chance to choose at that time again, still I would do the same things as I did before. The reason is different though the fact of choice seems almost remain the same.

To be continued.
