It may not suit to be cited as a reference basis for French learning, cause I learn it by standing on another language's shoulders. But at least for me, it is a feasible and comfortable way. I want to write it here in case of any possible usefulness.



Before my actual engagement in French learning, I worried a lot. I would meet obstacles never faced as a guy who knew only English and Chinese. I need to tell different properties between féminin and masculin. The complexity of numbers should also be a big problem. Placing my tongue at odd positions was another challenge that frightened me. However, these anxieties appeared only before my actual involvement in practice. Once practicing, all the unrelated emotions went away.



The lesson is the same as I learned in writing. Once you make up your mind to do something or have inclinations to carry out a project planned long ago. The first thing we should do is to get rid of hesitations as soon as possible. By what? Just do it. If a method is needed to improve your success rate, it must be setting a deadline. As Luxun said, DDL is the primarily productive force.



When it comes to language learning, we should firstly know what a language means. It is not a target, an achievement, a milestone in life, or a way of self-proving. Language is the apprehension about the world from a group of people. Accumulated from ancient times, the language is developing all the time with the ones using it. The language is not a dead thing or just a still mixture of letters or symbols. Rather, it lives a vivid life in intimate connections with the outer world. If made a metaphor, the language is like a human. It is you, and it is me.



If so, grammar isn't that important in the learning circle. As a native Chinese speaker, I didn't even realize the existence of Chinese grammar before being told by my teacher in primary school. Of course, there must be some rules, customs, or conventions which we think can be felt while speaking the language. But is grammar the actual basic structure of a language as the steel structure of an architecture?



I don't think so, though I can not give spotless evidence for this assertion. 



To be continued.
